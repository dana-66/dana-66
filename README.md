# Hey there 👋 I'm Dana

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a Computer Engineering graduate with a deep love for building creative, practical, and sometimes just plain fun tech projects. Currently, I'm volunteering as a Teaching Assistant with Dr. Faten Abu Shamalah, helping undergraduates explore topics like Risk Management and Web Development using PHP.

From designing sleek web apps with React and TailwindCSS to exploring low-level systems with VHDL and C, I enjoy working across the full tech stack — and I'm always hungry to learn more. Whether it's writing clean code, debugging late at night with a coffee in hand, or diving into cryptography and networking, I love turning ideas into real, working solutions.

## 💻 A quick tour of my work

### ✍️ Technical Articles (EN/AR)  
> Sharing what I learn — one article at a time.  
I write technical articles in **both English and Arabic**, covering topics I’m currently learning or find fascinating — from networking fundamentals to web security, system tools, and beyond.  
I publish on **[Medium](https://medium.com/@danatarik66)** for EN and on **[RowadTech](https://rowad-tech.org/lmsdq-authentication-fy-ttbyqt-lwyb-kyf-bnhmy-bynt-lmstkhdmyn-wwyn-laalm-mtjh-fy-hy-lnhy/)** in AR to help others and reflect on my own journey.  

### 📚 CCNA Commands Sheets  
> Bridging my web development background with my Network Engineering journey.  
[Live Demo](https://ccnacomandhelpersheet.netlify.app/)  
I'm building structured, visually clean, and easy-to-navigate **study sheets for CCNA topics and network topics** and how to troubleshoot them — leveraging Vanila JavaScript and TailwindCSS to make networking concepts more accessible for myself and others.  
**Tech Used**: JS, TailwindCSS  
👉 **its still a Work in progress*

### 🥘 Al Salam Restaurant  
> A responsive restaurant website with smooth animations and clean UI.  
[Live Demo](https://salampsresturant.netlify.app/)  
A modern web experience for a local restaurant. I used **React**, **GSAP**, and **TailwindCSS** to build a fully responsive website with animated sections, smooth scroll interactions, and a user-friendly layout.

### 🚀 CityChrono
> All your city needs in one place — time, weather, news, music, and a todo list.
CityChrono lets users search for any city worldwide and get real-time weather, local news, a world clock, radio streams, and Spotify playlists — all while managing their daily tasks.  
**Tech Used**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs, Bootstrap

### 🌸 Bloom & Fungi
> A charming ecommerce site for bouquets, plants, and mushrooms.   
[Live Demo](https://bloom8fungi.netlify.app/)  
Built with **React**, **Vite**, and **TailwindCSS**, this app combines aesthetic design with smooth functionality.

### 🔐 Cryptographic Coprocessor
> Exploring secure systems through VHDL.
One of my proudest academic projects — I designed and simulated a cryptographic coprocessor using VHDL. It’s what truly pulled me deeper into the world of secure systems and low-level design.

### 🐚 Custom C Shell
> A command-line shell written from scratch in C.
Created for my OS course, this project taught me so much about memory management, process handling, and how operating systems really work behind the scenes.
